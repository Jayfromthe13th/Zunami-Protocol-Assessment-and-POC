# Zunami Protocol Attack Analysis⚠️

## Summary
This project serves as a detailed postmortem analysis of the Zunami Protocol attack, a significant security breach in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that led to substantial financial losses. The primary goal is to replicate and understand the mechanics of the attack for educational and preventative purposes.

## Project Description
In this repository, we delve into the specifics of the Zunami Protocol attack that occurred on August 13, 2023. The attack, resulting in over $2 million USD in losses, exploited vulnerabilities in the protocol's smart contract. Through a controlled replication of the attack, this project aims to:

- Analyze the step-by-step execution of the exploit.
- Identify the key vulnerabilities that allowed the attack to occur.
- Provide insights into better security practices and preventative measures for DeFi platforms.

This project is intended for educational use, offering valuable lessons for developers, security researchers, and enthusiasts in the DeFi space.
